# Comprehensive Review of Model Context Protocol Specification v2025-03-26

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive quality review of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification version 2025-03-26. The review identifies 23 significant issues (15 critical, 8 moderate) that impact implementation clarity, JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance, and security. The specification, while comprehensive in scope, lacks the formal rigor expected of a technical standard.

## 1. JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance Issues

### CRITICAL: Request ID Restrictions Violate JSON-RPC 2.0

**Location**: Basic Protocol section, schema.ts lines defining RequestId type  
**Text**: "Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`"

This directly contradicts JSON-RPC 2.0 specification section 4, which explicitly allows null as a valid id value for requests. The MCP spec acknowledges this deviation but doesn't justify why it's necessary or how implementations should handle JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant messages with null IDs.

### CRITICAL: Batch Request Restrictions

**Location**: Basic Protocol section  
**Text**: "The initialize request **MUST NOT** be part of a JSON-RPC batch"

This restriction violates JSON-RPC 2.0's design principle that ANY valid requests can be batched. The spec doesn't explain how to enforce this at the protocol level or what error should be returned if this rule is violated.

### MODERATE: Error Code Range Ambiguity

**Location**: schema.ts, error handling sections  
The spec uses error codes like `-32002` (Resource not found) without defining the full range of MCP-specific error codes or explaining how they relate to JSON-RPC 2.0's reserved error code ranges (-32768 to -32000 for pre-defined errors, -32099 to -32000 for server-errors).

## 2. Protocol Flow and Lifecycle Issues

### CRITICAL: Ambiguous Initialization State Machine

**Location**: Lifecycle section  
The spec states clients "SHOULD NOT" send requests before initialization response, but then says they can send pings. The state machine is not formally defined:

- What happens if a client sends a non-ping request before initialization?
- What error code should be returned?
- Can servers process queued requests after initialization completes?

### CRITICAL: Session Management Ambiguity in HTTP Transport

**Location**: Streamable HTTP transport section  
**Text**: "If an `Mcp-Session-Id` is returned by the server during initialization..."

The spec doesn't clarify:

- Can servers change session IDs mid-session?
- What happens to in-flight requests when a session expires?
- How do batch requests interact with session expiration?

### MODERATE: Capability Negotiation Incompleteness

**Location**: Capabilities sections throughout  
The spec allows "experimental" capabilities but provides no namespacing requirements or collision prevention mechanism. Two implementations could define conflicting experimental capabilities.

## 3. Transport Layer Issues

### CRITICAL: Security Vulnerability in HTTP Transport

**Location**: Streamable HTTP section  
**Text**: "Servers **MUST** validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections"

The spec mentions DNS rebinding attacks but doesn't specify:

- What constitutes valid Origin header validation
- How to handle missing Origin headers
- Whether CORS policies should be implemented

### CRITICAL: Undefined Resumability Semantics

**Location**: Streamable HTTP, Resumability section  
**Text**: "The server **MAY** use this header to replay messages"

The spec doesn't define:

- How long servers must retain messages for replay
- Whether replayed messages get new timestamps
- How to handle partial message replay failures

### MODERATE: stdio Transport Binary Safety

**Location**: stdio transport section  
**Text**: "Messages **MUST NOT** contain embedded newlines"

This restriction makes it impossible to send certain content (like source code with newlines) without encoding. The spec doesn't specify the required encoding mechanism.

## 4. Data Type and Schema Issues

### CRITICAL: Cursor Opacity Violation

**Location**: Pagination section, schema.ts Cursor type  
**Text**: "Clients **MUST** treat cursors as opaque tokens"

Yet the schema defines Cursor as simply `type Cursor = string` with no enforcement mechanism. Nothing prevents clients from parsing cursor contents.

### CRITICAL: Resource URI Ambiguity

**Location**: Resources section  
**Text**: "The URI can use any protocol; it is up to the server how to interpret it"

This is too vague. Without constraints on URI schemes or validation requirements, interoperability is compromised. What happens if a client doesn't understand a server's custom URI scheme?

### MODERATE: Annotations Type Safety

**Location**: schema.ts, Annotations interface  
The `audience` field is defined as `Role[]` where Role is "user" | "assistant", but the spec doesn't explain what it means for content to have multiple audiences or how clients should interpret this.

## 5. Server Feature Issues

### CRITICAL: Tool Security Model Undefined

**Location**: Tools section  
**Text**: "For trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always be a human in the loop"

This critical security requirement is marked as "SHOULD" not "MUST", and provides no protocol-level enforcement mechanism. The spec doesn't define:

- How to implement human-in-the-loop at the protocol level
- What constitutes sufficient user consent
- How to audit tool invocations

### CRITICAL: Embedded Resource Recursion

**Location**: Resources section, EmbeddedResource type  
The spec allows resources to be embedded in prompts and tool results, but doesn't address:

- Maximum embedding depth
- Circular reference prevention
- Resource size limits for embedding

### MODERATE: Progress Notification Race Conditions

**Location**: Progress utilities section  
**Text**: "Progress notifications **MUST** stop after completion"

But there's no mechanism to ensure the final progress notification arrives before the response. This creates race conditions.

## 6. Client Feature Issues

### CRITICAL: Sampling Security Underspecified

**Location**: Sampling section  
**Text**: "Applications **SHOULD**: Provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests"

Critical security features are marked as "SHOULD" without protocol-level requirements. The spec doesn't define:

- Minimum information that must be shown to users
- How to prevent prompt injection attacks
- Rate limiting requirements

### MODERATE: Root URI Format Restrictions

**Location**: Roots section  
**Text**: "This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current specification"

The spec acknowledges this may change but provides no extension mechanism or version negotiation for when it does change.

## 7. General Protocol Issues

### CRITICAL: Missing Formal Grammar

The spec lacks formal grammar definitions (like ABNF) for:

- Message formats
- URI templates
- Header formats
- Cursor formats

This makes it impossible to build compliant parsers or validators.

### CRITICAL: No Conformance Levels

The spec mixes MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements without defining conformance levels. Is an implementation compliant if it implements all MUSTs but no SHOULDs?

### MODERATE: Inconsistent Null Handling

The schema sometimes uses `field?: T`, sometimes `field: T | null`, and sometimes `field: T | undefined` without explaining the semantic differences.

### MODERATE: No Protocol Versioning Strategy

While the protocol has a version ("2025-03-26"), there's no defined strategy for:

- Backward compatibility requirements
- Version negotiation beyond initialization
- Deprecation timelines

## 8. Missing Specifications

### CRITICAL: No Formal State Machine

The protocol implies complex state machines but never formally defines them for:

- Connection lifecycle
- Resource subscriptions
- Tool invocations
- Session management

### CRITICAL: No Interoperability Test Suite

The spec lacks:

- Canonical test cases
- Compliance test requirements
- Reference implementation requirements

## Summary by Severity

### CRITICAL ISSUES (15)

Fundamental ambiguities that prevent correct implementation:

- JSON-RPC 2.0 violations
- Security model gaps
- Undefined state machines
- Missing formal specifications

### MODERATE ISSUES (8)

Clarity problems that may lead to incompatible implementations:

- Incomplete error handling
- Type safety issues
- Missing extension mechanisms

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol specification v2025-03-26, while comprehensive in scope, lacks the formal rigor expected of a technical standard. Key issues include violations of JSON-RPC 2.0, underspecified security requirements, and missing formal definitions that would enable automated compliance testing. These issues must be addressed to ensure interoperable implementations and maintain security standards.
